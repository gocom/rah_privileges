Privileges can be configured in Textpattern admin at *Admin* / *Preferences* and from the page *Privileges* section. From there you can set which user groups have access to which different resources.

Also resources added by plugins can be modified, as long as rah_privileges is set to load after the plugin that is adding the resource, and the plugin adds the resource during its initial initialization and not dynamically later on.
